# RAEmus

All emulators used for interfacing with RetroAchievements.org

The source files of the emulators here were previously on the [RASuite repository](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RASuite),
but since April/2018 that repo is being used for `RA_Integration` code only.

If you are interested in contribute to RetroAchievements project with code on the emulators front, consider working
on the [RALibretro](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RALibretro).
